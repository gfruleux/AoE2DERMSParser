** Age Of Empires 2 : Definitive Edition Random Map Scripts Cleaner **

Lets you generate the clean version of GeneratingObjects for a specified RMS !
All the constants will be used to get what the game use to generate the map objects :)

The program will prompt two things
1) First Dialog, for the directory in which you want the output files
2) Second Dialog, to select the RMS files to clean-up (multiple at once)
Et voila.


Limitations:
* Doesn't work with conditional RMS (like MegaRandom) because of the Random Percents used to define constants on the fly.
Thus, the program would need to iterate over all and every possible arrangements and generate equivalent files



Evolutions:
* Select Map Type (Tiny, Medium, Huge etc) as it influence the generated map
Update generated map name with the map type
